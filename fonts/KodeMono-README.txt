Place Kode Mono font files in this `fonts/` folder so the site can use them locally.

Expected filenames (used by the CSS):
- KodeMono-Regular.woff2    (regular weight)
- KodeMono-Regular.woff     (optional fallback)
- KodeMono-Bold.woff2       (bold weight)
- KodeMono-Bold.woff        (optional fallback)

How to obtain the font:
- If you have a license or downloaded Kode Mono from a vendor, copy the .woff2/.woff files here and reload the page.
- If you want, upload the font files here and I can place them for you.

Usage examples (in HTML):
- Using the template you provided, replace <uniquifier> with any id you want:
  <span class="kode-mono-9a34">Example</span>

- Or use the provided utility classes:
  <span class="kode-mono-regular">regular weight text</span>
  <span class="kode-mono-bold">bold weight text</span>

Notes:
- `font-optical-sizing` is included but browser support may vary.
- If you prefer a Google-hosted fallback, tell me and I can add a fallback import.
